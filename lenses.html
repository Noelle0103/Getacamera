    How do camera lenses work?
  </div>

  <div>
   
      <p>This one will be much simpler, and I'll avoid getting too technical as it gets very deep into physics. There are also a lot of different kind of effects lenses can achieve, so if you're looking for a specific effect it's best to find the effect and research arouand it.</p> 
      <p>As such, I'll cover two basic effects of lenses, both as results of zoom. The first effect is fairly self evident, and that it makes distant subjects larger in frame. The further your zoom, however, the less light you acquire in your exposure. Balance for this accordingly! Zoom is measured in focal length, in mm.</p>
      <p>A lens with more zoom also shapes light differently as it enters the aperture. It's difficult to explain this effect, So I'll have two images attached to aid the point.</p>
