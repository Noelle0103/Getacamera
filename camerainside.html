    How does a camera work?

      <p>This may look even more complicated than the previous, but I'll walk you through it. When a camera takes an exposure, it starts with light coming in from the lens. The lens will bend the light, and each lens will bend or magnify it in different ways, which we'll discuss later.</p> 
      <p>Light then travels through the aperture, which can open and contract. You can think of this like the iris in your eye, which opens more in low light and closes in bright light. However, as a photographer, you can decide how open or closed the aperture is, and by that end, how much light enters the image.</p>
      <p>Light then hits the mirror, which bounces up to the viewfinder, where you can see the image before your photo is taken. When a photo is taken, the mirror flips up and lets light hit the sensor instead. The photographer can decide how long this process takes, with longer exposures being brighter but introducing the chance for an image to blur if things are not still.</p>
      <p>You may notice that quite a few things can effect the image. There's a lot of oppurtinity for artistic expression in this which we'll explore as well. </p>
